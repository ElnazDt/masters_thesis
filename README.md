Autonomous Vehicle Behaviour at Unregulated Intersections: Managing Ideal and Unexpected Scenarios

Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Communication
This repository explores autonomous vehicle behavior at unsignalized intersections, focusing on decision-making in both ideal and unpredictable scenarios. It includes simulation models and algorithms that incorporate:

Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) Communication:
Enables vehicles to share data such as position, speed, and trajectory directly with nearby vehicles. This helps improve coordination, reduce collisions, and optimize right-of-way decisions at intersections without traffic lights.

Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Communication:
Allows vehicles to interact with roadside infrastructure (e.g., sensors, edge servers). V2I provides additional context—such as pedestrian detection or emergency vehicle warnings—enhancing safety in mixed-traffic environments.

These communication models are central to building safer and smarter autonomous systems capable of handling both structured and dynamic real-world situations.
